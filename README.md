Learning pytorch

# Dependencies
* python 3.7
* pytorch 1.5.0
* cudatoolkit 10.2.89
* torchvision 0.6.0 

Local Machine specs - 128gb ram, NVIDIA quadro K600
Found GPU0 Quadro K600 which is of cuda capability 3.0.
PyTorch no longer supports this GPU because it is too old.
The minimum cuda capability that we support is 3.5.
	
NOTE: The default version of torch vision -torchvision 0.2.2. You may run into the error "ImportError: cannot import name 'PILLOW_VERSION' from 'PIL'"
This got fixed in torchvision 0.5.0

# Deep Learning with PyTorch
This repo contains self-practiced excercises for Udacity's Deep Learning with PyTorch lesson. This lesson appears in our [AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-programming-python-nanodegree--nd089).

* **Part 1:** Introduction to PyTorch and using tensors
* **Part 2:** Building fully-connected neural networks with PyTorch
* **Part 3:** How to train a fully-connected network with backpropagation on MNIST
* **Part 4:** Exercise - train a neural network on Fashion-MNIST
* **Part 5:** Using a trained network for making predictions and validating networks
* **Part 6:** How to save and load trained models
* **Part 7:** Load image data with torchvision, also data augmentation
* **Part 8:** Use transfer learning to train a state-of-the-art image classifier for dogs and cats
